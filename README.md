# DSA Implementations

This repository contains my implementations of various Data Structures and Algorithms in different programming languages.

## Contents

The repository is organized by programming language:

-   [`cpp/`](./cpp/): Contains C++ implementations.
-   [`python/`](./python/): Contains Python implementations.

Within each language folder, algorithms and data structures are typically organized by category.

## How to Use

Feel free to browse the code and use it for your learning or reference. Each implementation aims to be self-explanatory.
# C++
1/ Download the header/file (using curl, you may use 'wget')
```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Haruky-dev/DSA/main/header.h
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Haruky-dev/DSA/main/file.h
```
2/ Import and compile (using g++ compiler, you may update it accordingly)
```C++
#include "header.h"

g++ main.cpp file.cpp -o app
```



## Contributing

While this repository primarily serves as a collection of my own implementations, I am open to suggestions and discussions. If you find any issues or have ideas for improvement, please feel free to open an issue.
